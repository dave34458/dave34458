## 🚀 Content
If you’ve stumbled onto my profile, congrats kasi nahanap mo ang Information Systems Old Testaments. Specifically,
✨ **Old finals for Benilde coding subjects** ✨  

This profile just contains **final projects**, assignments, and others for uni.  

> ⚠️ Honest disclaimer: I **hate coding sm**. This is more like my school stuff rather than a portfolio.
